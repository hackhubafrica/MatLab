Matplotlib, Pandas,Seaborn, Bokeh, Plotly, Altair, GGPlot, GeoPandas, and VisPy.

Python GUI libraries like Qt and Tkinter.

Matplotlib is a visualization library, used to create static 2D plots

Pandas is a data analysis and manipulation library.Pandas is frequently used alongside the other data visualization libraries - to prepare the data in question for analysis.

Seaborn is a visualization library that adds onto Matplotlib’s basic functions. Seaborn is intended to enable the easy creation of informative and attractive visualizations

GeoPandas is an extension to the Pandas plotting library designed to make it easier to work with geospatial/geographical data. 

Bokeh is a visualization library that allows the user to create interactive visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks and web browsers. Bokeh is focused on the production of highly interactive visualizations, unlike Matplotlib which has just a handful of interactive options.
Visualizations in Bokeh are based around objects called “glyphs”, which you can render in numerous different shapes and styles


Plotly is designed specifically with the purpose of creating interactive plots. Plotly supports numerous use cases like statistical, geographic, scientific, and even 3D datasets. Similar to Bokeh’s use of glyphs, the fundamental unit of a Plotly plot is the “trace”. You can combine multiple traces and display them all on a single figure.

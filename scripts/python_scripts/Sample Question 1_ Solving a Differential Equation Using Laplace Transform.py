Sample Question 1: Solving a Differential Equation Using Laplace Transform.py
Question: Solve the differential equation 
洧녬**2洧녽(洧노)/洧녬洧노**2+3洧녬洧녽(洧노)/洧녬洧노+2洧녽(洧노)=洧녹(洧노) with initial conditions 
洧녽(0)=0 and 洧녬洧녽(0)/洧녬洧노=0 , where 洧녹(洧노)is a step input.

import sympy as sp

# Define the Laplace variable and time variable
s, t = sp.symbols('s t')
Y = sp.Function('Y')(s)
U = 1 / s  # Laplace transform of the step input u(t)

# Define the differential equation in Laplace domain
diff_eq = s**2 * Y + 3 * s * Y + 2 * Y - U

# Solve for Y(s)
Y_s = sp.solve(diff_eq, Y)[0]

# Perform the inverse Laplace transform to find y(t)
y_t = sp.inverse_laplace_transform(Y_s, s, t)

# Output the result
print(f"Solution y(t): {y_t}")
